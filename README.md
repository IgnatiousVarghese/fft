# Polynomial multiplication using theFFT algorithm

1. Write a program that implements polynomial multiplication using the FFT algorithm given in the text book.
2. The input polynomials for the program may be in the form of integer vectors.
3. The input may be read either from a terminal or a file.
4. The implementation must be in OCaml (https://ocaml.org/).
